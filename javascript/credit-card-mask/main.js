/*
  Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit
  card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question
  is still correct. However, since someone could look over your
  shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we
  mask it.

  Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but
  the last four characters into '#'.

  Examples (input --> output):
    "4556364607935616" --> "############5616"
        "64607935616" -->      "#######5616"
                  "1" -->                "1"
                    "" -->                 ""

    // "What was the name of your first pet?"
    "Skippy" --> "##ippy"
    "Nananananananananananananananana Batman!" --> "####################################man!"
*/

/**
 *
 * @param {string} cc
 * @return string
 */
function maskify(cc) {
  if (4 >= cc.length) {
    return cc;
  }
  let result = "";
  const limit = cc.length - 4;
  for (let i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
    result += "#";
  }
  result += cc.slice(-4)
  return result;
}

module.exports = { maskify, };
