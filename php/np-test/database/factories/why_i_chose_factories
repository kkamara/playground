Factories are great!

No, this is simply an optimal solution that gets the 
job done in a swift manner that allows your efforts 
to be spent elsewhere.

Laravel Factory is optimal because of the following:
* works with very minimal setup, plug n play there abouts
* is already plugged in to system classes for convenient usage
* creating a new factory is simply a cli away ;)

For me this blows other solutions out of the water by being
already a piece of the Laravel system making it easy to work with. 

However, should another solution fill my need to the point that
Laravel Factory is no longer a viable solution; there would be
nothing wrong with a change of service.

Since Laravel 5.2 I have yet to see the day another factory service
fit my needs better than Laravel's own. I have seen one implementation
opt for a third party package for the 
aforementioned "right tool for the job" reason.
